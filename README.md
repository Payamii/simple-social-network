#### This is a Django project that I used templates to write.

+ It is a simple social network where users can post text, follow each other , like and comment others post. 

+ use "docker-compose up -d" command to create an image or use venv to run the project.

    *In writing this program, I got help from the codes that I had written along with the training of Mongard website*
